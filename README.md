# nvim-aseprite
Tools and commands for working with Aseprite plugin projects in Neovim.

* Commands for launching Aseprite and testing plugins
* This plugin wraps a [fork](https://github.com/scatternoodle/aseprite-lualib) of [RampantDespair's excellent definitions library](https://github.com/RampantDespair/Aseprite-Library). It dynamically detects when an Aseprite plugin project is opened, and inserts Aseprite API types and globals into the Lua language server (lua_ls) workspace.

**_nvim-aseprite is currently experimental and should be considered unstable until it reaches a 1.0 release._**

## Setup

### Dependencies 
* [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
* [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/) (lua_ls) must be installed and enabled for this plugin to function. This is [available natively](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#lsp-quickstart) in Neovim via lspconfig.

### Installation
It is recommended to use a plugin manager, such as `lazy.nvim`. Either way,
ensure that plugin load and setup function run early - this is critical for
parts of the plugin such as LSP support to function correctly. For lazy.nvim
users, this means either setting `lazy = false` or `event = "VeryLazy"`.

Example setup using `lazy.nvim`
```lua
	"scatternoodle/nvim-aseprite",
	event = "VeryLazy",
	opts = {},
	keys = {
		{ "<leader>a", desc = "Aseprite" },
		{ "<leader>ar", "<cmd>AsepriteRestart<cr>", desc = "Restart Aseprite" },
		{ "<leader>as", "<cmd>AsepriteStop<cr>", desc = "Stop Aseprite" },
	},
```

### Configuration

Default config options:
```Lua
aseprite.options_defaults = {
	path_aseprite_binary = "aseprite", -- custom aseprite install path
}
```

## Usage

Get full documentation including commands inside Neovim with `:help aseprite`. Read on for a note about Aseprite project detection.

### Aseprite project detection
The plugin only loads if an Aseprite plugin is detected. There is no official Aseprite standard for this (such as a uniquely-named RC file or directory structure) so we have devised our own for this plugin. Simply place a file named `.aseprite` wtihin your project directory. This can be at the root of the project, but does not need to be. The file can be empty, and indeed, any content inside will be ignored.
