INTRODUCTION *nvim-aseprite*
nvim-aseprite dynamically detects when an Aseprite plugin project is opened,
and inserts Aseprite API Lua type definitions into the lua_ls workspace.

Please ensure there is a file named '.aseprite' within your project, preferrably
in the root directory. This file should be empty and any content inside will be
ignored. The plugin will detect the presence of this file to identify the 
workspace as an Aseprite project.
